# Grid Pathfinding Algorithms: Improved MAACO & MPA

## ðŸ§­ Introduction

This is the repo containing the implementation of two pathfinding algorithms for grid environments.

- **MAACO improvement** (Modified Adaptive Ant Colony Optimization): an extended version of ACO with a **crossing prohibition mechanism**, aimed at ensuring valid and accurate paths in a grid environment with obstacles..
- **MPA (Marine Predators Algorithm)**: an algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of marine animals, applied to find the shortest path in a discrete environment.
  
Both algorithms are designed to operate efficiently on a **grid map** with empty cells (movable) and wall cells (obstacles).
